# 🌦️ Cloud-Based Distributed Weather Forecasting System Using Real-Time Data

A scalable, cloud-native weather forecasting system that collects real-time data from NOAA, processes it using AWS services (Kinesis, Lambda, S3, SageMaker), and generates 7-day forecasts with alerting and visualization capabilities.

## 🧠 Overview

This project aims to provide real-time and accurate weather forecasting using a distributed architecture. It uses live weather data from NOAA’s GHCND API and feeds it into an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built entirely on AWS.

Key goals:
- Automate live weather data ingestion
- Train and deploy LSTM models for 7-day forecasts
- Visualize predictions using a web dashboard
- Trigger alerts for extreme weather conditions and cost usage

## 🏗️ Architecture

NOAA API → Python Script → AWS Kinesis → Lambda (to S3) ↓ Lambda (Cleaner + Merger) ↓ Cleaned CSV → SageMaker (LSTM) ↓ Forecast Output → S3 → Streamlit ↓ Alerts via SNS

## ⚙️ System Components

### 🔁 Data Ingestion
- A Lambda function fetches real-time NOAA data using the `GHCND:USW00023234` station (LAX).
- The script pushes structured records into **Amazon Kinesis**.

### 📦 Data Storage
- Another Lambda function reads from Kinesis and writes JSON data into **S3** (`weather_data/`).

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
- A cleaning Lambda merges JSONs and produces `cleaned_weather_dataset.csv` using pandas.

### 🤖 LSTM Forecasting
- A multivariate LSTM model trained on 14-day sequences forecasts 7 days of:
  - Wind (`AWND`, `WSF2`)
  - Temperature (`TMAX`, `TMIN`)
  - Precipitation (`PRCP`)
  - Weather conditions (`WT08`)

### 📊 Visualization
- Streamlit dashboard allows users to upload `forecast_7day.csv` and view feature-wise plots.

### ⚠️ Alerting
- A Lambda function checks the forecast for:
  - `WT08 == 1` (Storm)
  - `TMAX > 100°F` (Heat)
  - `WSF2 > 50` (High Wind)
- Alerts are sent via **SNS email notifications**.

## 🚀 Setup & Deployment

1. **S3 Bucket Setup**  
   Create a bucket: `kinesis-lambda-s3-bucket1`

2. **NOAA API Token**  
   [Register here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token)

3. **Environment Variables for Lambda**
   ```env
   NOAA_API_TOKEN = <your_token>
   AWS_REGION = us-east-1
   KINESIS_STREAM_NAME = weather-stream
Create and Connect

Amazon Kinesis Stream: weather-stream

IAM Roles for Lambda & SageMaker

Lambda Layer for pandas (optional): Klayers-p39-pandas

Train LSTM Model Save lstm_multivariate_7day.pth to S3 or local

Run Forecast Script outputs forecast_7day.csv

Launch Dashboard

bash

Edit
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
📢 Alerting Mechanism
Weather alert Lambda triggers when:

WT08 == 1 → Storm

TMAX > 100°F → High temperature

WSF2 > 50 mph → Wind alert

SNS topics send emails to subscribed addresses.

📊 Dashboard Demo
Feature	Description
Upload CSV	Accepts forecast_7day.csv
Graphs	Line charts for 11+ features
Labeling	Forecast dates + severity flags

streamlit_app.py handles dynamic charting and date filtering.

🧱 Challenges & Mitigations
Challenge	Mitigation
NOAA API rate limits	Retry logic, date fallback
Lambda size limits (pandas)	Switched to Lambda layers
Cost of SageMaker	Spot instances + local prototyping
Power BI S3 issues	Replaced with Streamlit
